Generally in India, we find that the most watched and loved sports is cricket and we generally 
found large set of people daily conversing with respect to the yesterday match saying he 
didn’t perform well or he shouldn’t have been selected, and especially IPL which is 
conducted during month of April – May , this is when all younger people would have 
finished there exams and at exactly 7:30pm be ready in front of there television to watch and 
support there team, this is the love people exhibit towards cricket in India.
This project introduces a predictive model designed to forecast the outcomes of Indian 
Premier League (IPL) matches, focusing on team victory probabilities and score predictions. 
Leveraging historical match data, player statistics, pitch conditions, and other relevant 
factors, the model employs machine learning algorithms to analyse and predict match results 
with high accuracy. By integrating advanced statistical techniques and predictive analytics, 
the model aims to provide valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, team management, and 
betting markets alike. Through rigorous validation and testing, the project demonstrates the 
efficacy of the predictive model in anticipating match outcomes and contributing to informed 
decision-making in the context of the IPL.
